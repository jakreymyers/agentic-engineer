# Background Agent Report - Wed_21_45_59

## Task Understanding
User requested:
1. Read ai_docs directory
2. Create a reusable three-file wrapper system for calling agents via Claude Code Python SDK
3. Implement adhoc_prompt(prompt, settings) function
4. Implement reusable_prompt(custom_slash_command, settings) function
5. Create pydantic types file for low-level definitions
6. Create CLI interface file
7. Structure as simple astral uv app in apps/cc_py_wrapper/

## Results
- ✅ Analyzed ai_docs directory (empty) and researched Claude Code Python SDK API
- ✅ Created complete three-file wrapper system in apps/cc_py_wrapper/
- ✅ Implemented `adhoc_prompt(prompt, settings)` function with full async support
- ✅ Implemented `reusable_prompt(custom_slash_command, settings)` function 
- ✅ Created comprehensive pydantic types file (types.py) with all necessary models
- ✅ Built CLI interface (cli.py) with full command-line functionality
- ✅ Set up simple astral uv app structure with pyproject.toml
- ✅ Added examples directory with usage examples and slash command configurations
- ✅ Created test file with unit tests and mocked SDK integration
- ✅ Generated comprehensive README.md with API documentation

## Files Created
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/__init__.py - Package exports and main imports
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/types.py - Pydantic type definitions (WrapperSettings, AgentResponse, etc.)
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/wrapper.py - Core wrapper functions (adhoc_prompt, reusable_prompt)
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/cli.py - Command-line interface with click integration
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/pyproject.toml - UV project configuration
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/README.md - Comprehensive documentation
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/test_wrapper.py - Unit tests with mocked SDK
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/examples/basic_usage.py - Usage examples
- apps/cc_py_wrapper/examples/slash_commands.json - Slash command configurations

## Task Completed
Successfully created a complete three-file wrapper system for Claude Code Python SDK with:

### Core Features
- **adhoc_prompt()**: Execute one-time prompts with optional settings
- **reusable_prompt()**: Execute slash commands with configuration
- **stream_adhoc_prompt()**: Real-time streaming responses
- **Full async support** with proper error handling
- **Pydantic validation** for all inputs/outputs

### Architecture
- **types.py**: Low-level Pydantic models for type safety
- **wrapper.py**: Core business logic and SDK integration  
- **cli.py**: Command-line interface for testing and automation

### Additional Features
- Slash command registration/management system
- Comprehensive CLI with streaming support
- Example configurations for common use cases
- Unit tests with mocked SDK integration
- Complete documentation and usage examples

The system is ready for use and can be installed with `uv install` in the apps/cc_py_wrapper directory.
