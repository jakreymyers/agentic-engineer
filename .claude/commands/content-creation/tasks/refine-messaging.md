# Refine Messaging

## Task Overview

Polish and optimize content messaging for maximum clarity, impact, and Jak's authentic voice.

## Prerequisites

- Draft content ready for refinement
- Understanding of Jak's writing principles
- Target audience clearly defined

## Steps

### 1. Voice Authenticity Check

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: structured**

Let me analyze the current messaging:

1. **Content to Refine**: [Paste the content that needs refinement]
2. **Target Platform**: LinkedIn post, blog article, or other?
3. **Primary Goal**: What should this content accomplish?
4. **Audience**: Who specifically is this for?

### 2. Jak's Voice Assessment

I'll evaluate against Jak's established principles:

**Voice Markers:**

- [ ] Sounds like Jak in conversation
- [ ] Direct without unnecessary complexity
- [ ] Practical rather than theoretical
- [ ] Includes personal experience/perspective
- [ ] Slightly contrarian when appropriate

**Red Flags:**

- Generic business advice that could come from anyone
- Corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Overly promotional or self-serving
- Abstract concepts without concrete examples
- Trying too hard to sound impressive

### 3. Clarity and Simplicity Audit

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: line-by-line**

I'll go through the content systematically:

**Sentence Structure:**

- Identify overly complex sentences
- Find passive voice constructions
- Highlight jargon or unnecessary complexity
- Note where active voice would improve clarity

**Paragraph Flow:**

- Check for logical progression
- Ensure each paragraph has a clear point
- Verify smooth transitions between ideas
- Confirm scannable format

### 4. Value Proposition Strengthening

I'll ensure the core value is crystal clear:

**Value Clarity:**

- Is the main benefit obvious within first 2 sentences?
- Can readers immediately understand "what's in it for me"?
- Are takeaways specific and actionable?
- Does it solve a real problem readers face?

**Evidence and Examples:**

- Replace abstract claims with concrete examples
- Add Jak's personal experience where relevant
- Include specific numbers, tools, or scenarios
- Show rather than tell wherever possible

### 5. Engagement Optimization

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: before/after**

I'll optimize for platform-specific engagement:

**Hook Refinement:**

- Current opening: [original first line]
- Refined options: [3-5 alternative openings]
- Recommendation: [best option with reasoning]

**Call-to-Action Enhancement:**

- Current CTA: [original ending]
- Refined options: [engagement-driving alternatives]
- Recommendation: [best option for discussion]

### 6. Jak's Principles Enforcement

I'll apply the non-negotiables ruthlessly:

**Active Voice Conversion:**

- "Data was analyzed" → "We analyzed the data"
- "Problems were identified" → "I identified problems"
- "Solutions can be enabled" → "Solutions work when..."

**Jargon Elimination:**

- "Leverage synergies" → "Work together"
- "Drive value" → "Help customers"
- "Enable stakeholders" → "Help teams"

**Quote Reduction:**

- Remove 9 out of 10 quotes from original
- Replace with paraphrasing for better flow
- Keep only the most impactful direct quotes

### 7. Show Don't Tell Audit

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: replacement**

I'll replace abstract with concrete:

**Before/After Examples:**

- "Our solution was groundbreaking" → "Our pipeline processed 10TB daily with 99.9% uptime"
- "Stakeholders were impressed" → "The CEO said it cut reporting time from days to hours"
- "We saw significant improvement" → "Error rates dropped from 15% to 0.3%"

### 8. Final Polish and Flow

I'll ensure the refined content flows naturally:

**Readability Check:**

- Read aloud test (does it sound natural?)
- Paragraph length appropriate for platform
- Transitions smooth and logical
- Conclusion ties back to opening

**Jak's Voice Confirmation:**

- Would Jak actually say this in person?
- Does it reflect his personality and style?
- Is the level of vulnerability/openness appropriate?
- Does it help others without being preachy?

### 9. Refined Content Delivery

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: final**

Here's your refined content:

[Polished version incorporating all improvements]

**Key Changes Made:**

- [List major improvements]
- [Explain voice adjustments]
- [Note value proposition strengthening]
