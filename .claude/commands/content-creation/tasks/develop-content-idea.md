# Develop Content Idea

## Task Overview

Transform a raw concept into a well-developed content idea ready for creation.

## Prerequisites

- Basic topic or concept identified
- Understanding of Kevin's expertise areas
- Access to thought development checklist

## Steps

### 1. Idea Capture & Context

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: structured**

I need to understand your initial concept. Please provide:

1. **Raw Idea**: What's the basic concept? (e.g., "data quality is overrated")
2. **Origin**: Where did this idea come from? (personal experience, observation, frustration)
3. **Initial Angle**: What's your gut feeling about the unique perspective?
4. **Target Audience**: Who needs to hear this? (data PMs, healthcare leaders, solopreneurs)

### 2. Expertise Validation

I'll assess whether this aligns with Kevin's credibility:

- **Domain Fit**: Does this leverage Kevin's healthcare/data expertise?
- **Experience Base**: Can Kevin speak from actual implementation?
- **Authenticity Check**: Would Kevin naturally discuss this topic?
- **Authority Level**: Is Kevin qualified to lead this conversation?

### 3. Uniqueness Assessment

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: choice**

Let me challenge the uniqueness of this idea:

Here are the potential unique angles I see:

1. [Contrarian take on conventional wisdom]
2. [Personal experience-based insight]
3. [Technical implementation reality]
4. [Healthcare-specific application]
5. [Solopreneur perspective]

Which resonates most, or do you see a different angle?

### 4. Evidence Gathering

I'll help identify supporting material:

- **Personal Stories**: Kevin's relevant experiences
- **Industry Examples**: Real companies/situations
- **Data Points**: Statistics or metrics if available
- **Contrarian Evidence**: Why conventional wisdom fails
- **Implementation Reality**: What actually happens in practice

### 5. Value Proposition Development

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: structured**

Let's clarify the reader value:

1. **Core Insight**: What's the key learning/realization?
2. **Practical Application**: How can readers use this?
3. **Problem Solving**: What specific problem does this address?
4. **Competitive Advantage**: How does this help them succeed?

### 6. Development Readiness Check

I'll validate the idea is ready for content creation:

**Readiness Criteria:**

- [ ] Unique angle identified
- [ ] Personal experience supports it
- [ ] Clear audience value
- [ ] Authentic to Kevin's voice
- [ ] Evidence available
- [ ] Actionable insights possible

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: confirm**

Based on our development, here's your refined content idea:

**Topic**: [Refined topic]
**Unique Angle**: [Kevin's specific perspective]
**Core Insight**: [Key learning]
**Evidence Base**: [Supporting material]
**Target Audience**: [Specific reader type]
**Value Proposition**: [How this helps readers]
