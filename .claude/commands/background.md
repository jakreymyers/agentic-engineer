# Background Claude Code

Run a Claude Code instance in the background to perform tasks autonomously while you continue working.

## Variables

USER_PROMPT: $1
MODEL: $2 (defaults to 'sonnet' if not provided)
REPORT_FILE: $3 (defaults to './agents/background/background-report-ĐAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS.md' if not provided)

## Instructions

- Capture timestamp in a variable FIRST to ensure consistency across file creation and references
- Create the initial report file with header BEFORE launching the background agent
- Fire off a new Claude Code instance using the Bash tool with run_in_background=true
- IMPORTANT: Pass the `USER_PROMPT` exactly as provided with no modifications
- Set the model to either 'sonnet' or 'opus' based on `MODEL` parameter
- Configure Claude Code with all necessary flags for automated operation
- All report format instructions are embedded in the --append-system-prompt
- Use --print flag to run in non-interactive mode
- Use --output-format text for standard text output
- Use --dangerously-skip-permissions to bypass permission prompts for automated operation
- Use all provided cli flags AS IS. Do not alter them.
- The append-system-prompt contains all report structure requirements and renaming logic
- IMPORTANT: Do not alter the append-system-prompt in any way.

## Workflow
1. Create the report directory if it doesn't exist:
    ```bash 
    mkdir -p agents/background
    ```

2. Set default values for parameters:
- `MODEL`
- `TIMESTAMP` (capture once for consistency)
- `REPORT_FILE` (using the captured timestamp)

3. Create the initial report file with just the header (IMPORTANT: Only IF no report file is provided - if it is provided, echo it and skip this step):
    Get this into your context window so you know what to pass into the Claude Code command.
    ```bash
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%a_%H_%M_%5)
    echo "TIMESTAMP: ${TIMESTAMP}"
    REPORT_FILE="${REPORT_FILE:-./agents/background/background-report-${TIMESTAMP}.md}"
    echo "REPORT_FILE: ${REPORT_FILE}"
    echo "# Background Agent Report - ${TIMESTAMP}" > "${REPORT_FILE}"
    ```

<primary-agent-delegation>
4. Construct the Claude Code command with all settings:

   - Execute the command using Bash with run_in_background=true

    ```bash
    claude \
        --model "${MODEL}" \
        --output-format text \
        --dangerously-skip-permissions \
        --append-system-prompt "IMPORTANT: You are running as a background agent. Your primary responsibility is to execute work and document your progress continuously in $(REPORT_FILE}. Iteratively write to the report file continuously as you work. Every few tool calls you should update the REPORT_FILE ## Progress section. Follow this file structure.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW STRUCTURE

   IMPORTANT: You MUST follow this workflow as you work:
   
   1. The file ${REPORT_FILE} has been created with a header. You must UPDATE as you proceed it (not recreate it) with this EXACT markdown structure:

    ```markdown
    # Background Agent Report - DAY-NAME_HH_MM_SS

    ## Task Understanding
    Clearly state what the user requested. Break down complex requests into numbered items:
    User requested:

    ## Results
    List concrete outcomes and deliverables with specific details. Update as you work:
    - [Specific file created/modified with path]
    - [Numeric data or metrics]
    - [Actual accomplishments]

    ## Task Completed (or Task Failed)
    [Final summary - success confirmation or failure explanation]
    
    ADDITIONAL SECTIONS (add as needed) :
      - ## Blockers - Issues preventing progress
      - ## Decisions Made - Important choices and rationale
      - ## Recommendations - Follow-up suggestions
      - ## Warnings - Important issues to note
  
    CONTINUOUSLY update ${REPORT_FILE) as you work - after each major step or finding.

    When you finish your work:
       - If successful: Rename $(REPORT_FILE) to $(REPORT_FILE.md}. complete.md
       - If failed/blocked: Rename ${REPORT_FILE) to ${REPORT_FILE.md}. failed. md
    
    Remember: The report is your PRIMARY output. Update it frequently and thoroughly.
    ```" \
        —-print "${USER_PROMPT}" 
</primary-agent-delegation>

2. After you kick off the background agent, use the BashOutput tool to check the status of the background agent
   - If something goes wrong investigate and report back to the user
   - If everything is working fine, continue to the 'Response to User' section

## Response to User

After launching the background agent, respond with:

```
Background Claude Code kicked off. Agent is writing to `REPORT_FILE` as it works.
When it completes it will rename the file to `REPORT_FILE.complete.md` on success or `REPORT_FILE.failed.md` if it fails.
```
