# Comprehensive User Research System Dependency Audit Report

## Executive Summary

A thorough audit of all 6 research agents reveals a system that is **82% complete** with critical gaps in the research-reporter agent. While 5 of 6 agents are fully functional, the research-reporter agent has only 58% of its dependencies implemented, creating a bottleneck in the system's ability to deliver insights.

**Critical Issues**:
- 11 Week 6 deliverables missing (should have been created)
- Agent commands reference tasks not in dependencies
- Cannot execute 12 of 16 commands

---

## Workflow Integration Status

All 5 workflows reference the agents correctly:

| Workflow | Agents Used | Status |
|----------|------------|---------|
| user-interview-research.yaml | All 6 agents | ✅ Created Week 7 |
| rapid-discovery.yaml | All 6 agents | ✅ Created Week 7 |
| conjoint-analysis.yaml | All 6 agents | ✅ Created Week 7 |
| ethnographic-research.yaml | All 6 agents | ✅ Created Week 7 |
| mixed-methods-research.yaml | All 6 agents | ✅ Created Week 7 |

**Note**: Workflows will have limited functionality due to research-reporter gaps

---

## Critical Path Analysis

### System Bottlenecks
1. **Research Reporter Agent**: Only 58% functional, blocking final deliverables
2. **Missing Sample Size Calculator**: Research Strategist cannot perform power analysis
3. **No Presentation Creation**: Cannot generate stakeholder presentations
4. **Missing Accessibility Standards**: Visualizations may not meet compliance

### Data Flow Issues
1. ✅ **FIXED**: Markdown to JSON conversion (data-format-converter created)
2. ❌ **BROKEN**: Quick wins extraction pipeline (task missing)
3. ❌ **BROKEN**: Narrative arc building (task missing)
4. ❌ **BROKEN**: Deliverable packaging (task missing)

## Implementation Timeline Analysis

| Week | Target | Actual | Completion |
|------|--------|--------|------------|
| Week 1 | Foundation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Week 2 | Strategy | ⚠️ 1 task missing | 95% |
| Week 3 | Interview | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Week 4 | Analysis | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Week 5 | Synthesis | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Week 6 | Reporting | ❌ 11 files missing | 62% |
| Week 7 | Workflows | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Week 8 | Quality | Not started | 0% |

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Complete Week 6 Implementation (CRITICAL)
**Missing Files to Create Immediately:**

#### Tasks (4 files)
1. `package-deliverables.md` - Essential for export-findings command
2. `create-presentation.md` - Required for stakeholder presentations
3. `extract-quick-wins.md` - Needed for rapid value identification
4. `build-narrative-arc.md` - Critical for storytelling

#### Templates (4 files)
1. `presentation-deck-tmpl.yaml` - Presentation structure
2. `insight-cards-tmpl.yaml` - Insight communication format
3. `dashboard-specs-tmpl.yaml` - Dashboard requirements
4. `handoff-doc-tmpl.yaml` - Knowledge transfer template

#### Data Resources (3 files)
1. `stakeholder-personas.md` - Audience understanding
2. `accessibility-standards.md` - Compliance requirements
3. `narrative-frameworks.md` - Storytelling patterns

### Priority 2: Fix Week 2 Gap
1. Create `calculate-sample-size.md` task for Research Strategist

### Priority 3: Update Documentation
1. Correct Week 6 implementation report to reflect actual status
2. Update research-reporter agent to list all command dependencies
3. Document the 11 missing Week 6 files as technical debt

### Priority 4: System Validation
1. Test all workflows end-to-end after completing missing files
2. Verify agent command execution with all dependencies
3. Validate data flow through complete pipeline

## Quality Metrics

### Content Quality Analysis
- **Average Lines per File**: 441 lines
- **Documentation Depth**: Exceptional (comprehensive elicitation)
- **YAML Structure**: Consistent and well-formed
- **Cross-references**: 95% valid (5% missing targets)

### Naming Convention Compliance
- **Files Following Standards**: 100% of existing files
- **Path Structure**: Correct (`user-research/{type}/{name}`)
- **Extension Consistency**: Perfect (.md for docs, .yaml for configs)

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **Research Reporter Non-functional**: Cannot deliver final outputs to stakeholders
2. **Missing Presentation Capability**: No automated presentation generation
3. **Accessibility Gap**: Visualizations may not meet standards

### Medium Risk
1. **Sample Size Calculator Missing**: Manual calculations required
2. **Incomplete Command Set**: Some agent commands will fail

### Low Risk
1. **Week 8 Checklists**: Expected to be missing, not blocking current function

---

## Conclusion

The User Research Multi-Agent System shows exceptional implementation quality in Weeks 1-5 and 7, but has a critical gap in Week 6 that severely impacts the Research Reporter agent. With 82% overall completion, the system requires immediate attention to the 11 missing Week 6 files to achieve full functionality.

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Create 11 missing Week 6 files** (4 tasks, 4 templates, 3 data resources)
2. **Create 1 missing Week 2 task** (calculate-sample-size.md)
3. **Update agent dependencies** to match command requirements
4. **Test end-to-end workflows** after completing missing files

### System Strengths
- Exceptional documentation depth (average 441 lines per file)
- Perfect naming convention compliance
- Strong architectural consistency
- Comprehensive elicitation patterns
- Robust error handling (Week 7 QA improvements)

### System Weaknesses
- Research Reporter only 58% functional
- 11 critical Week 6 files missing
- Incomplete dependency declarations in agents
- False completion claims in Week 6 report

**Overall Assessment**: The system is well-architected but requires immediate completion of Week 6 deliverables to be production-ready. Once the 12 missing files are created, the system will be fully operational with comprehensive research capabilities.
