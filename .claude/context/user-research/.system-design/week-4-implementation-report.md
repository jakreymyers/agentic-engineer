## Architectural Insights

### 1. Analysis Complexity Scaling
Week 4 introduces the most complex workflows yet, with the analyze-transcript task containing 5 passes and 6 elicitation points. This reflects the iterative, reflexive nature of qualitative analysis that cannot be rushed or automated.

### 2. Template Sophistication
The coding-framework template at 20KB is the largest single template, reflecting the need for comprehensive structure in systematic analysis. The framework includes evolution tracking, showing that analysis frameworks must be living documents.

### 3. Knowledge Resource Integration
Week 4's knowledge resources are tightly integrated, with coding-frameworks.md referencing analysis-methods.md which connects to statistical-tests.md. This web of knowledge enables sophisticated decision-making.

### 4. Statistical Rigor
The perform-statistical-analysis task includes mandatory assumption testing, reflecting a commitment to validity over convenience. This prevents common statistical errors that plague research.
