# Coding Frameworks for Qualitative Analysis

## Overview

Coding frameworks provide systematic approaches for analyzing qualitative data. This resource describes major frameworks, their applications, and selection criteria.

## Major Coding Frameworks

### 1. Grounded Theory Coding

**Description:** Systematic approach for developing theory from data through iterative coding.

**Coding Stages:**
1. **Open Coding:** Initial, unrestricted coding of data
2. **Axial Coding:** Organizing codes into categories and relationships
3. **Selective Coding:** Developing core categories and theory

**When to Use:**
- No existing theory for phenomenon
- Building new theoretical understanding
- Exploratory research

**Process:**
- Start with no preconceived codes
- Let codes emerge from data
- Constant comparison method
- Theoretical sampling
- Saturation determines completion

### 2. Thematic Analysis Framework

**Description:** Flexible approach for identifying patterns and themes across dataset.

**Six Phases:**
1. Familiarization with data
2. Generating initial codes
3. Searching for themes
4. Reviewing themes
5. Defining and naming themes
6. Producing the report

**When to Use:**
- Identifying patterns across dataset
- Flexible theoretical approach needed
- Mixed inductive/deductive coding

**Key Features:**
- Can be purely inductive or theory-driven
- Works with various theoretical frameworks
- Accessible to novice researchers

### 3. Framework Analysis

**Description:** Systematic approach using matrix output for organizing and analyzing data.

**Five Stages:**
1. Familiarization
2. Identifying thematic framework
3. Indexing (applying framework)
4. Charting (data extraction)
5. Mapping and interpretation

**When to Use:**
- Applied policy research
- Multi-disciplinary teams
- Pre-defined objectives
- Time-limited projects

**Characteristics:**
- Matrix-based approach
- Balance between deductive/inductive
- Transparent and systematic
- Good for team analysis

### 4. Content Analysis

**Description:** Systematic categorization of text to identify patterns, themes, and meanings.

**Types:**
- **Conventional:** Codes derived from data
- **Directed:** Start with theory/prior research
- **Summative:** Counting and comparisons

**When to Use:**
- Quantifying qualitative data
- Testing hypotheses
- Comparing across sources
- Systematic documentation needed

**Process:**
- Define coding unit (word, sentence, paragraph)
- Develop coding scheme
- Apply codes systematically
- Calculate frequencies/percentages
- Assess reliability

### 5. Phenomenological Analysis (IPA)

**Description:** Explores how individuals make sense of lived experiences.

**Analytical Stages:**
1. Reading and re-reading
2. Initial noting
3. Developing emergent themes
4. Searching for connections
5. Moving to next case
6. Looking for patterns across cases

**When to Use:**
- Understanding lived experience
- Small, homogeneous samples
- Idiographic focus
- Psychological phenomena

### 6. Narrative Analysis

**Description:** Analyzes stories people tell about their experiences.

**Approaches:**
- **Structural:** How stories are constructed
- **Thematic:** What stories are about
- **Dialogic:** Interactive production of stories
- **Visual:** Including images in narrative

**When to Use:**
- Life history research
- Identity studies
- Temporal sequences important
- Individual cases focus

## Coding Approach Selection

### Decision Factors

| Factor | Consideration | Framework Implication |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Research Question | Exploratory vs. Confirmatory | Grounded Theory vs. Content Analysis |
| Theoretical Stance | Inductive vs. Deductive | Thematic vs. Framework Analysis |
| Sample Size | Large vs. Small | Content Analysis vs. IPA |
| Time Available | Extensive vs. Limited | Grounded Theory vs. Framework |
| Team Size | Solo vs. Team | Any vs. Framework Analysis |
| Output Needed | Theory vs. Description | Grounded Theory vs. Thematic |

## Hybrid Approaches

### Combining Frameworks

**Common Combinations:**
- Thematic + Content: Themes with frequencies
- Grounded + Narrative: Theory from stories
- Framework + Phenomenological: Structured experience analysis

**Integration Strategies:**
1. Sequential: One approach then another
2. Concurrent: Multiple approaches simultaneously
3. Embedded: One approach within another

## Code Development Strategies

### Inductive Coding
**Bottom-up approach:**
- Codes emerge from data
- No preconceived framework
- Data-driven categories
- Theory development possible

**Process:**
1. Immerse in data
2. Note initial observations
3. Generate codes from patterns
4. Group into categories
5. Develop themes

### Deductive Coding
**Top-down approach:**
- Pre-existing framework
- Theory-driven codes
- Hypothesis testing
- Structured analysis

**Process:**
1. Define theoretical framework
2. Create codebook
3. Apply codes to data
4. Assess fit
5. Refine as needed

### Hybrid Coding
**Combined approach:**
- Start with broad framework
- Allow emergent codes
- Balance structure and flexibility
- Iterative refinement

## Code Types and Hierarchies

### Code Types

**Descriptive Codes:**
- Summarize topic
- Low inference
- "What" is happening

**Interpretive Codes:**
- Infer meaning
- Higher abstraction
- "Why" it matters

**Pattern Codes:**
- Identify relationships
- Group concepts
- Meta-level analysis

### Hierarchical Structure

```
Level 1: Domains (Broadest)
  ├── Level 2: Categories
  │   ├── Level 3: Codes
  │   │   └── Level 4: Sub-codes (Most specific)
```

**Guidelines:**
- 3-4 levels maximum
- 5-7 items per level
- Mutually exclusive at same level
- Exhaustive coverage

## Ensuring Coding Quality

### Reliability Measures

**Inter-coder Agreement:**
- Simple agreement: >80%
- Cohen's Kappa: >0.70
- Multiple coders when possible

**Strategies:**
1. Clear code definitions
2. Coding manual/codebook
3. Practice coding sessions
4. Regular calibration meetings
5. Disagreement resolution process

### Validity Considerations

**Ensuring Valid Coding:**
- Member checking
- Peer debriefing
- Negative case analysis
- Prolonged engagement
- Triangulation
- Audit trail

## Common Coding Challenges
