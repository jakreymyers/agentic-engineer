# Persona Development Frameworks

## Overview

This knowledge resource provides comprehensive frameworks and methodologies for developing evidence-based user personas from research data. Personas are archetypal representations of user segments that help teams empathize with and design for their users.

## Core Principles

### Evidence-Based Development
- **Every attribute must trace to research data**
- **Minimum 3 participants per persona** for validity
- **Behavioral focus over demographics**
- **Quotes and observations required** for all characteristics
- **Contradictions explicitly addressed**

### Persona Quality Criteria
1. **Distinct:** Each persona represents a unique segment
2. **Memorable:** Easy to remember and reference
3. **Actionable:** Drives design decisions
4. **Realistic:** Based on actual users, not stereotypes
5. **Evolving:** Updated as users and contexts change

## Major Persona Frameworks

### 1. Cooper's Goal-Directed Personas

**Developer:** Alan Cooper
**Focus:** User goals and behaviors

**Components:**
- **Primary Persona:** Must be satisfied; can't be happy if another persona is satisfied instead
- **Secondary Persona:** Mostly satisfied by primary persona's interface with minor adjustments
- **Supplemental Persona:** Satisfied by combination of other personas
- **Customer Persona:** Not an end user but influences purchase decisions
- **Served Persona:** Directly affected by product use but doesn't use it
- **Negative Persona:** Who we're NOT designing for

**Development Process:**
1. Identify behavioral variables
2. Map interview subjects to variables
3. Identify significant behavior patterns
4. Synthesize characteristics and goals
5. Check for completeness and redundancy
6. Expand description of attributes
7. Designate persona types

**Best For:** Software and digital product design

### 2. Pruitt & Adlin's Persona Lifecycle

**Developers:** John Pruitt & Tamara Adlin
**Focus:** Organizational adoption and maintenance

**Lifecycle Phases:**
1. **Family Planning:** Organizational preparation
2. **Conception & Gestation:** Data collection and analysis
3. **Birth & Maturation:** Persona creation and enrichment
4. **Adulthood:** Active use in design process
5. **Retirement:** Archiving or updating

**Key Components:**
- **Foundation Documents:** Core characteristics
- **Persona Comparison Chart:** Differentiation matrix
- **Persona Weighted Matrix:** Priority scoring
- **Scenario Collection:** Use case library

**Best For:** Enterprise environments requiring buy-in

### 3. Lean Personas

**Developer:** Jeff Gothelf
**Focus:** Rapid, assumption-based starting point

**Format:**
```
Sketch & Name
Behavioral Demographic
Pain Points & Needs
Potential Solutions
```

**Process:**
1. Start with assumptions
2. Create proto-personas quickly
3. Validate through research
4. Iterate based on learning

**Best For:** Startups and rapid prototyping

### 4. Jobs-to-be-Done Personas

**Developer:** Clayton Christensen adaptation
**Focus:** Jobs users hire products to do

**Components:**
- **Job Executor:** Who's trying to get the job done
- **Job Map:** Steps in executing the job
- **Desired Outcomes:** Success metrics
- **Constraints:** Limitations and barriers
- **Circumstances:** When and where job arises

**Best For:** Innovation and new product development

### 5. Behavioral Personas

**Focus:** Observable behaviors over attitudes

**Key Dimensions:**
- **Behavioral Patterns:** What they actually do
- **Mental Models:** How they think about the domain
- **Motivations:** What drives their behavior
- **Pain Points:** What frustrates them
- **Goals:** What they're trying to achieve

**Development Method:**
1. Behavioral variable identification
2. Participant mapping
3. Pattern identification
4. Persona skeleton creation
5. Enrichment with quotes
6. Validation against scenarios

**Best For:** UX design and service design

## Persona Creation Methods

### Method 1: Affinity Diagramming

**Process:**
1. Extract behavioral observations from research
2. Cluster similar behaviors
3. Identify patterns within clusters
4. Name emerging segments
5. Develop into full personas

**Tools Needed:**
- Sticky notes or digital equivalents
- Large workspace
- Research data excerpts

### Method 2: Statistical Clustering

**Process:**
1. Code research data into variables
2. Perform cluster analysis
3. Identify statistically significant segments
4. Validate clusters qualitatively
5. Develop personas from clusters

**Tools Needed:**
- Statistical software (R, SPSS, etc.)
- Coded research data
- Cluster validation metrics

### Method 3: Spectrum Mapping

**Process:**
1. Identify key behavioral dimensions
2. Map participants along each spectrum
3. Look for clustering patterns
4. Define segment boundaries
5. Create personas at cluster centers

**Example Dimensions:**
- Novice ← → Expert
- Risk-averse ← → Risk-taking
- Independent ← → Collaborative
- Speed-focused ← → Quality-focused

### Method 4: Scenario-Based Development

**Process:**
1. Identify key scenarios from research
2. Group users by scenario approach
3. Extract common characteristics
4. Build personas around scenario patterns
5. Validate with additional scenarios

## Persona Attributes Framework

### Core Attributes (Required)

**Identity:**
- Functional name/title (not a person's name)
- Defining quote from research
- Segment size (% of users)
- Confidence level

**Behaviors:**
- Observed actions (5-7 key behaviors)
- Workflow patterns
- Tool usage
- Decision-making patterns

**Goals & Motivations:**
- Primary goals (3-5)
- Underlying motivations
- Success criteria
- Jobs-to-be-done

**Frustrations:**
- Major pain points
- Barriers to success
- Unmet needs
- Current workarounds

### Context Attributes (Recommended)

**Environment:**
- Work/use environment
- Social context
- Constraints (time, budget, technical)
- External pressures

**Mental Models:**
- Conceptual models
- Assumptions and beliefs
- Vocabulary/terminology
- Knowledge gaps

**Scenarios:**
- Typical use cases
- Edge cases
- Failure scenarios

### Extended Attributes (Optional)

**Demographics:** (Only if relevant to design)
- Age range
- Education level
- Geographic location
- Industry/domain

**Psychographics:**
- Values and attitudes
- Lifestyle factors
- Media consumption
- Brand preferences

## Avoiding Persona Pitfalls

### Common Mistakes

1. **Stereotype Personas**
   - Problem: Based on assumptions not data
   - Solution: Require evidence for every attribute

2. **Demographic Personas**
   - Problem: Focus on demographics over behavior
   - Solution: Lead with behavioral patterns

3. **Too Many Personas**
   - Problem: Dilutes focus, hard to remember
   - Solution: Limit to 3-5 primary personas

4. **Elastic Personas**
   - Problem: Stretched to cover everyone
   - Solution: Accept that you can't design for everyone

5. **Precision Personas**
   - Problem: False precision (e.g., "32 years old")
   - Solution: Use ranges and acknowledge uncertainty

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**The Average User:**
- Nobody is average in all dimensions
- Design for specific segments, not averages

**The Edge Case Expert:**
- Don't design primarily for power users
- Balance needs of different expertise levels

**The Demographic Twin:**
- Same demographics ≠ same behaviors
- Focus on behavioral differentiation

**The Franken-Persona:**
- Stitching together unrelated attributes
- Ensure internal consistency

## Validation Techniques

### Scenario Validation
1. Create realistic scenarios
2. Walk through with each persona
3. Check if responses make sense
4. Adjust if behaviors inconsistent

### Participant Validation
1. Show personas to research participants
2. Ask if they recognize themselves
3. Gather feedback on accuracy
4. Refine based on input

### Stakeholder Validation
1. Present to team members
2. Test understanding and memorability
3. Verify usefulness for decisions
4. Iterate based on feedback

### Predictive Validation
1. Use personas to predict behavior
2. Test predictions with new research
3. Measure accuracy
4. Update personas based on results

## Persona Evolution Framework

### When to Update Personas

**Triggers for Review:**
- Major market changes
- New product capabilities
- User behavior shifts
- Business model changes
- 12-18 months since last update

### Update Process

1. **Audit Current Personas**
   - Still distinct?
   - Still accurate?
   - Still useful?

2. **Gather New Data**
   - Recent research findings
   - Analytics insights
   - Support feedback
   - Market changes

3. **Identify Changes**
   - New behaviors
   - Shifted goals
   - Different contexts
   - Emerging segments

4. **Update or Retire**
   - Refine existing personas
   - Create new personas
   - Retire obsolete personas
   - Document changes

## Using Personas Effectively

### In Design Decisions
- "How would [Persona] react to this?"
- "Which persona benefits most?"
- "Does this solve [Persona]'s problem?"

### In Prioritization
