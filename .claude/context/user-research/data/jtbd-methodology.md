# Jobs-to-be-Done Methodology

## Overview

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a framework for understanding what motivates people to make the choices they do. Rather than focusing on products, services, or customer demographics, JTBD looks at what people are trying to achieve in a given circumstance - the "job" they're trying to get done.

## Core Concepts

### What is a Job?

A **Job** is the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance. Jobs are:

- **Functional:** Have a practical objective to achieve
- **Emotional:** Include feelings and personal aspirations
- **Social:** Consider how others perceive us
- **Stable over time:** Jobs don't change much, though solutions do
- **Solution agnostic:** Define the goal, not the means

### Key Principles

1. **People don't buy products; they hire them to do jobs**
2. **Jobs arise in specific circumstances**
3. **Good solutions integrate functional, emotional, and social dimensions**
4. **Competition is defined by the job, not the product category**
5. **Innovation opportunities exist where jobs are poorly served**

## The JTBD Framework

### Job Statement Structure

**Format:** [Verb] + [Object] + [Contextual Clarifier]

**Examples:**
- "Pass time while waiting for an appointment"
- "Stay connected with family when traveling"
- "Minimize errors when entering data under time pressure"
- "Feel confident about investment decisions during market volatility"

### Three Levels of Jobs

1. **Big Jobs (Aspirations)**
   - Long-term objectives
   - Example: "Live a healthy lifestyle"

2. **Small Jobs (Main Focus)**
   - Specific tasks with clear success criteria
   - Example: "Find healthy breakfast options when rushed"

3. **Little Jobs (Micro-Jobs)**
   - Related tasks that support bigger jobs
   - Example: "Check nutritional information quickly"

## The Forces of Progress Framework

### The Four Forces

**Push Forces** (Away from current situation)
- **Push of the Situation:** Problems with current solution
  - Functional problems
  - Emotional frustrations
  - Social pressures

**Pull Forces** (Toward new solution)
- **Pull of the New Idea:** Attraction of new solution
  - Promise of improvement
  - Exciting possibilities
  - Social benefits

**Anxiety Forces** (Resistance to new solution)
- **Anxiety of the New Solution:** Fears about change
  - Learning curve
  - Risk of failure
  - Social judgment

**Habit Forces** (Attachment to current)
- **Habit of the Present:** Comfort with status quo
  - Familiar processes
  - Sunk costs
  - Social norms

### Forces Balance

Progress happens when:
**Push + Pull > Anxiety + Habit**

## Job Dimensions

### 1. Functional Dimension
**What users need to accomplish**

Components:
- Core functional outcome
- Process requirements
- Performance criteria
- Constraints to work within

Questions to uncover:
- What are you trying to get done?
- What would success look like?
- What makes this hard?
- How do you measure progress?

### 2. Emotional Dimension
**How users want to feel**

Components:
- Desired feelings
- Feelings to avoid
- Confidence needs
- Peace of mind requirements

Questions to uncover:
- How do you want to feel?
- What worries you about this?
- What would give you confidence?
- What emotional state are you seeking?

### 3. Social Dimension
**How users want to be perceived**

Components:
- Image to project
- Relationships to maintain
- Status to achieve
- Groups to belong to

Questions to uncover:
- Who else is affected by this choice?
- How do you want others to see you?
- What would others think?
- Whose opinion matters here?

## JTBD Research Methods

### 1. Switch Interviews

**Purpose:** Understand why people switched solutions

**Process:**
1. Find recent switchers
2. Start with "Tell me about when you..."
3. Work backward to first thought
4. Uncover struggling moments
5. Identify forces at play
6. Document the timeline

**Key Questions:**
- When did you first think about switching?
- What triggered that thought?
- What else did you consider?
- What almost stopped you?
- What finally convinced you?

### 2. Timeline Reconstruction

**Purpose:** Map the complete journey

**Steps:**
1. First thought
2. Passive looking
3. Active looking
4. Decision
5. Purchase/adoption
6. Ongoing use

**For each step, document:**
- What happened
- How they felt
- Who was involved
- What they did
- Why it mattered

### 3. Struggling Moment Identification

**Purpose:** Find where demand exists

**Types of Struggles:**
- **Non-consumption:** Using nothing
- **Compensating behaviors:** Workarounds
- **Multiple products:** Cobbling solutions
- **Complaints:** Verbal frustrations

**Questions:**
- Tell me about the last time you struggled with...
- What workarounds have you created?
- When do you avoid doing this altogether?
- What would you do if this option didn't exist?

### 4. Forces Mapping

**Purpose:** Understand decision dynamics

**Process:**
1. List all push forces (problems with current)
2. List all pull forces (attraction to new)
3. List anxieties (concerns about new)
4. List habits (attachment to current)
5. Rate strength of each force (1-10)
6. Identify intervention points

## Outcome-Driven Innovation (ODI)

### Outcome Statement Structure

**Format:** [Direction] + [Metric] + [Object] + [Contextual Clarifier]

**Examples:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to find relevant information"
- "Maximize the likelihood that data is accurate"
- "Increase confidence in decision quality"
- "Reduce the effort required to share results"

### Outcome Types

1. **Speed:** Minimize time
2. **Stability:** Ensure consistency
3. **Output:** Maximize quantity/quality
4. **Consumption:** Minimize resource use
5. **Reliability:** Increase predictability
6. **Accessibility:** Ease of access/use

### Opportunity Algorithm

**Opportunity = Importance + (Importance - Satisfaction)**

- High opportunity: Important but unsatisfied
- Low opportunity: Satisfied or unimportant
- Over-served: Satisfaction exceeds importance

## Job Mapping Process

### Universal Job Map

1. **Define:** Plan and prepare
2. **Locate:** Find needed inputs
3. **Prepare:** Organize and setup
4. **Confirm:** Verify readiness
5. **Execute:** Perform the job
6. **Monitor:** Track progress
7. **Modify:** Make adjustments
8. **Conclude:** Finish and clean up

### For Each Step, Identify:
- Desired outcomes
- Current solutions
- Pain points
- Time spent
- Error likelihood
- Emotional state

## Finding Innovation Opportunities

### Undershot vs Overshot Jobs

**Undershot Jobs:**
- Important outcomes unsatisfied
- Users cobble together solutions
- High willingness to pay for better
- Innovation focus: Performance improvement

**Overshot Jobs:**
- Current solutions too complex/expensive
- Users want simpler options
- Price sensitivity high
- Innovation focus: Simplification, cost reduction

### Non-Consumption Opportunities

**Why People Don't Consume:**
- Lack of skill
- Lack of money
- Lack of access
- Lack of time

**Innovation Strategies:**
- Make it simpler
- Make it cheaper
- Make it accessible
- Make it faster

### Job Growth Strategies

1. **Execute current job better**
   - Improve core performance
   - Reduce variability
   - Increase speed

2. **Execute more of the job**
   - Take over adjacent steps
   - Provide end-to-end solution
   - Integrate related jobs

3. **Execute related jobs**
   - Bundle complementary jobs
   - Create job platforms
   - Enable job chains

## JTBD vs Other Frameworks

### JTBD vs Personas

**Personas focus on:**
- Who the user is
- Demographics and psychographics
- General behaviors and preferences

**JTBD focuses on:**
- What progress users seek
- Specific circumstances
- Causal mechanisms

**Use both when:**
- Personas for empathy
- JTBD for innovation

### JTBD vs User Stories

**User Stories:**
- As a [user type]
- I want [feature]
- So that [benefit]

**JTBD:**
- When [situation]
- I want to [job]
- So I can [progress]

**Key Difference:** JTBD focuses on progress, not features

### JTBD vs Design Thinking

**Complementary approaches:**
- Design Thinking: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test
- JTBD: Provides structure for Define phase
- Use JTBD to identify jobs, Design Thinking to create solutions

## Applying JTBD

### In Product Development

1. **Identify poorly satisfied jobs**
2. **Define desired outcomes**
3. **Design integrated solutions**
4. **Test against job success criteria**
5. **Iterate based on job performance**

### In Marketing

1. **Message the job, not the product**
2. **Show the struggle and resolution**
3. **Address anxieties explicitly**
4. **Highlight progress achieved**
5. **Use customer language**

### In Strategy

1. **Define competition by job**
2. **Identify non-consumption**
3. **Find overserved segments**
4. **Create job-based segments**
5. **Plan portfolio by jobs**

## Common JTBD Pitfalls

### Mistake 1: Focusing on Activities vs Outcomes
- Wrong: "Use a spreadsheet"
- Right: "Track project progress accurately"

### Mistake 2: Being Too Broad
- Wrong: "Be successful"
- Right: "Close deals faster with enterprise clients"

### Mistake 3: Confusing Jobs with Solutions
- Wrong: "Have a mobile app"
- Right: "Access information on the go"

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Context
- Wrong: "Communicate with team"
- Right: "Coordinate with remote team across time zones"

### Mistake 5: Missing Emotional/Social Dimensions
- Wrong: Only functional requirements
- Right: Integrated functional, emotional, social

## JTBD Interview Guide

### Opening Questions
1. "Tell me about the last time you..."
2. "When did you first realize you needed..."
3. "Walk me through how you decided..."

### Exploring the Job
1. "What were you trying to accomplish?"
2. "Why was that important then?"
3. "How did you know when you succeeded?"
4. "What would have happened if you didn't?"

### Understanding Forces
1. "What wasn't working before?"
2. "What attracted you to this solution?"
3. "What almost stopped you?"
4. "What concerns did you have?"

### Uncovering Outcomes
1. "How do you measure success?"
2. "What's the hardest part?"
3. "What takes the most time?"
4. "What worries you most?"

### Social Dimension
1. "Who else was involved?"
2. "What did others think?"
3. "How did this affect your image?"
4. "Whose opinion mattered?"

## Synthesis and Analysis

### Pattern Recognition

Look for:
- Common struggling moments
- Repeated workarounds
- Similar force patterns
- Consistent outcomes desired
- Shared anxieties

### Job Prioritization

Consider:
- Frequency: How often does job arise?
- Importance: How critical when it does?
- Satisfaction: How well currently served?
- Population: How many have this job?
- Willingness to pay: Value of better solution?

### Solution Criteria Development

Based on jobs, define:
- Must achieve (critical outcomes)
- Should achieve (important outcomes)
- Could achieve (nice-to-have outcomes)
- Won't achieve (out of scope)

## Summary

Jobs-to-be-Done provides a powerful lens for understanding why people make the choices they do. By focusing on the progress people are trying to make rather than their characteristics or current solutions, JTBD reveals innovation opportunities and guides the creation of products and services that people will enthusiastically hire.

The key is to look beyond the functional job to understand the emotional and social dimensions, map the forces that drive behavior change, and identify the outcomes that define success. When applied rigorously, JTBD transforms how we understand users and design solutions.
