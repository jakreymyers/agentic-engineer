# Research Ethics Guidelines

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Respect for Persons
- Treat participants as autonomous agents
- Protect those with diminished autonomy (minors, vulnerable populations)
- Honor participant decisions and boundaries
- Ensure voluntary participation without coercion

### 2. Beneficence
- Maximize benefits of research
- Minimize potential harms
- Risk-benefit assessment before research
- Protect participant wellbeing throughout

### 3. Justice
- Fair distribution of research benefits and burdens
- Equitable participant selection
- Appropriate compensation
- Inclusive research practices

### 4. Integrity
- Honest and transparent research practices
- Accurate representation of findings
- Acknowledge limitations and biases
- Maintain professional boundaries

## Informed Consent

### Essential Elements
1. **Research Purpose**: Clear explanation of study goals
2. **Procedures**: What participation involves
3. **Duration**: Time commitment required
4. **Risks**: Potential discomforts or risks
5. **Benefits**: Direct and societal benefits
6. **Compensation**: Payment or incentives
7. **Confidentiality**: How data will be protected
8. **Voluntary**: Right to refuse or withdraw
9. **Contact**: Researcher contact information

### Consent Documentation
- Written consent for high-risk research
- Verbal consent acceptable for low-risk
- Document consent process
- Provide copy to participant
- Store securely and separately from data

### Special Populations
- **Minors**: Parental consent + child assent
- **Employees**: Emphasize no employment impact
- **Patients**: Clinical vs research distinction
- **International**: Cultural considerations

---

## Privacy and Confidentiality

### Data Protection
- Collect minimum necessary data
- De-identify data when possible
- Secure storage and transmission
- Limited access on need-to-know basis
- Retention and deletion policies

### Anonymity vs Confidentiality
- **Anonymity**: No link between data and identity
- **Confidentiality**: Identity known but protected
- Be accurate about which you're providing
- Explain any limits to confidentiality

### Data Handling
- Separate identifiers from data
- Use participant codes, not names
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Secure physical documents
- Cloud storage compliance (GDPR, CCPA)

---

## Participant Welfare

### Minimizing Harm
- Anticipate potential distress
- Provide support resources
- Monitor for signs of discomfort
- Have stopping protocols
- Debrief after sensitive topics

### Power Dynamics
- Recognize researcher-participant power imbalance
- Avoid exploitation
- Ensure truly voluntary participation
- Be sensitive to cultural differences
- Maintain professional boundaries

### Vulnerable Populations
- Additional protections required
- Consider capacity to consent
- Assess risk-benefit carefully
- Include advocates when appropriate
- Extra privacy safeguards

---

## Compensation and Incentives

### Fair Compensation
- Value participant time appropriately
- Consider preparation time
- Account for travel/expenses
- Match market rates
- Progressive payment for longitudinal

### Avoiding Coercion
- Incentives should not be coercive
- Consider participant circumstances
- Avoid excessive compensation
- Pro-rate for partial completion
- Clear payment terms upfront

### Types of Compensation
- Monetary payment (preferred)
- Gift cards or vouchers
- Product samples or discounts
- Charity donations
- Entry into drawings (less preferred)

---

## International and Cultural Considerations

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Research culturally appropriate methods
- Use local cultural advisors
- Adapt consent processes
- Consider language needs
- Respect cultural norms

### International Compliance
- **GDPR (EU)**: Lawful basis, data minimization
- **CCPA (California)**: Consumer rights, opt-out
- **PIPEDA (Canada)**: Consent and purpose
- **Local Laws**: Country-specific requirements

### Translation and Interpretation
- Professional translation of materials
- Back-translation for accuracy
- Interpreter for interviews if needed
- Cultural adaptation beyond translation

---

## Institutional Review

### When IRB Review Required
- Federally funded research (US)
- Academic research
- Medical/health research
- Research with vulnerable populations
- Publication requirements

### IRB Submission Components
- Research protocol
- Consent forms
- Recruitment materials
- Survey instruments
- Risk assessment
- Researcher qualifications

### Review Levels
- **Exempt**: Minimal risk, common procedures
- **Expedited**: Minimal risk, specific categories
- **Full Board**: More than minimal risk

---

## Data Management

### Collection Principles
- Purpose limitation
- Data minimization
- Accuracy
- Storage limitation
- Security
- Accountability

### Retention and Deletion
- Define retention period upfront
- Justify retention duration
- Secure deletion methods
- Document deletion
- Consider data value vs risk

### Sharing and Publication
- Aggregate reporting only
- Remove identifiers for sharing
- Participant permission for quotes
- Consider re-identification risk
- Open science considerations

## Quick Decision Guides

### Is IRB Review Needed?
```
Is it research? (Generalizable knowledge)
├─ No → IRB not needed
└─ Yes → Continue
   │
   Is it human subjects research?
   ├─ No → IRB not needed
   └─ Yes → Continue
      │
      Federally funded or regulated?
      ├─ Yes → IRB required
      └─ No → Check institutional policy
```

### Consent Decision Tree
```
Risk Level Assessment
├─ Minimal Risk
│  ├─ Anonymous data → Information sheet
│  └─ Identified data → Verbal/written consent
└─ More than Minimal
   ├─ Vulnerable population → Written + extra protections
   └─ General population → Written consent
```

### Data Retention Decision
```
Determine Data Type
├─ Identifiable Data
│  ├─ Delete after analysis
│  └─ Justify if keeping longer
└─ De-identified Data
   ├─ Research value high → Retain with plan
   └─ Research value low → Delete after project
