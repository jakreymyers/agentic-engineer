# User Research Multi-Agent System Tool Specification Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive audit of the User Research Multi-Agent System tool specifications reveals critical integration gaps, missing specifications, and alignment issues that must be addressed for successful system operation. Five tools are referenced throughout the system, but only three have specifications, and those existing specifications contain significant integration mismatches.

**Critical Findings:**
- 2 of 5 required tools completely missing specifications
- 100% of existing tool specs have integration misalignments
- Input/output format mismatches across agent workflows
- Missing API specifications for agent command structures
- Insufficient performance requirements for workflow timelines

## Audit Methodology

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Tool Specifications (SEVERITY: CRITICAL)

#### research-sentiment-analyzer
- **Referenced in**: conduct-sentiment-analysis.md task, mixed-methods workflow
- **Required by**: Data Analyst Agent (Alex) for emotion and sentiment analysis
- **Integration Points**: Must output format compatible with research-stats-analyzer for quantitative validation
- **Impact**: Cannot execute sentiment analysis workflows, blocking mixed-methods research

#### research-viz-generator
- **Referenced in**: conjoint-analysis.yaml, mixed-methods-research.yaml, reporting tasks
- **Required by**: Research Reporter Agent for visualization generation
- **Integration Points**: Must accept input from all other tools for comprehensive visualizations
- **Impact**: Cannot generate publication-ready reports and presentations

### 2. Integration Misalignments (SEVERITY: HIGH)

#### intelligent-transcription-service Output Format Issues
**Problem**: Output format doesn't align with analyze-transcript task requirements

**Current Output Structure**:
```json
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": "speaker_1",
      "text": "Thank you for joining us today...",
