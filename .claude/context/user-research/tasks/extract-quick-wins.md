# Extract Quick Wins

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:
1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each phase must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Quick wins must be systematically identified and validated

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete quick wins list without user interaction at elicitation points, you have violated this workflow.

8. Monitoring dashboard and optimization process

## Common Quick Wins Failures

**Avoid These Pitfalls:**
1. **Scope Creep** - Simple changes become complex projects
2. **Overestimation** - Benefits projected too optimistically
3. **Underestimation** - Implementation effort miscalculated
4. **Poor Metrics** - Success not properly measured
5. **Stakeholder Neglect** - Insufficient buy-in and communication
6. **Quality Compromise** - Rushing implementation sacrifices quality
7. **One-Time Fixes** - Not building sustainable improvement processes
8. **Isolation** - Quick wins not connected to broader strategy

## Success Indicators

Quick wins program succeeds when:
1. Wins are delivered on time and within budget
2. Measurable improvements in user experience achieved
3. Positive ROI demonstrated with quantified benefits
4. Team confidence and capability enhanced
5. Stakeholder satisfaction and engagement increased
6. Foundation built for larger transformation initiatives
7. Continuous improvement culture established

## CRITICAL REMINDER

This is an INTERACTIVE WORKFLOW requiring user participation at each elicitation point. The 1-9 option format is MANDATORY. Creating complete quick wins analysis without user interaction violates this task specification.
