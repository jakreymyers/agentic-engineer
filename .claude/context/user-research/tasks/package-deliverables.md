# Package Deliverables

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:
1. **DISABLE ALL EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATIONS** - This workflow requires full user interaction
2. **MANDATORY STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION** - Each phase must be processed sequentially with user feedback
3. **ELICITATION IS REQUIRED** - When `elicit: true`, you MUST use the 1-9 format and wait for user response
4. **NO SHORTCUTS ALLOWED** - Deliverable packaging must be systematically organized

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you create a complete package without user interaction at elicitation points, you have violated this workflow.

2. **Format Inconsistency** - Mixed styles and standards
3. **Poor Organization** - Confusing file structure
4. **Accessibility Gaps** - Non-compliant formats
5. **Version Confusion** - Unclear version control
6. **Missing Context** - No usage guidance
7. **Security Oversights** - Inadequate protection
8. **Update Challenges** - No maintenance plan

## Success Indicators

Package succeeds when:
1. All stakeholders can access needed materials
2. Information is easily findable and usable
