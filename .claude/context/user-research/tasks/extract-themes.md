# Extract Themes - Systematic Pattern Identification

## ⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION NOTICE ⚠️

**THIS IS AN EXECUTABLE WORKFLOW - NOT REFERENCE MATERIAL**

When this task is invoked:
1. **MANDATORY USER INTERACTION** - Theme validation requires user input
2. **SYSTEMATIC PROGRESSION** - Each phase builds on previous findings
3. **ELICITATION REQUIRED** - User must confirm theme definitions
4. **NO AUTONOMOUS COMPLETION** - Themes need human validation

**VIOLATION INDICATOR:** If you generate final themes without user validation, you have violated this workflow.

## Task Configuration

```yaml
task: extract-themes
elicit: true
template: coding-framework-tmpl.yaml
output: analysis/themes/{project}-theme-framework.md
prerequisites:
  - Coded transcripts available
  - Initial codes identified
  - Multiple data sources coded
data_dependencies:
  - coding-frameworks.md

```

## Theme Extraction Process

### Phase 1: Code Collation and Review

**Objective:** Gather all codes and prepare for pattern analysis

**Process:**
1. **Collect All Codes Across Sources**
   ```
   Code Inventory:
   - Source: [Transcript/Document ID]
   - Code: [Code Name]
   - Frequency: [Count]
   - Definition: [What this code represents]
   - Example: [Representative quote]
   ```

2. **Create Code Frequency Matrix**
   - List all unique codes
   - Count appearances across sources
   - Calculate relative frequencies
   - Identify most prevalent codes

3. **Initial Pattern Recognition**
   - Codes that frequently co-occur
   - Codes that never appear together
   - Sequential patterns in data
   - Contextual patterns

**Elicitation Point 1:** [elicit: true]
Present code collation results. Offer options:
1. Proceed to Phase 2 (Pattern Search)
2. Review code definitions for consistency
3. Merge redundant codes
4. Split complex codes
5. Add missing codes identified
6. Examine code co-occurrences
7. Analyze code distributions
8. Check code completeness
9. Review outlier codes

### Phase 2: Searching for Patterns

**Objective:** Identify recurring patterns and potential themes

**Pattern Detection Methods:**

1. **Repetition Analysis**
   - Topics recurring across participants
   - Phrases used multiple times
   - Concepts appearing in different forms
   - Ideas expressed consistently

2. **Similarity Clustering**
   ```
   Cluster Example:
   Codes: "email overload", "too many messages", "inbox anxiety"
   Pattern: Communication overwhelm
   Potential Theme: Digital communication burden
   ```

3. **Difference Mapping**
   - Contrasting perspectives on same topic
   - Variations in experience
   - Opposing viewpoints
   - Contextual differences

4. **Sequence Identification**
   - Common progressions or journeys
   - Cause-effect relationships
   - Temporal patterns
   - Process flows

**Pattern Documentation Template:**
```
Pattern ID: [P001]
Pattern Type: [Repetition/Similarity/Difference/Sequence]
Related Codes: [List of codes]
Frequency: [How often observed]
Description: [What the pattern represents]
Supporting Evidence: [Quotes/examples]
```

**Elicitation Point 2:** [elicit: true]

### Phase 3: Constructing Initial Themes

**Objective:** Transform patterns into coherent themes

**Theme Development Process:**

1. **Pattern Synthesis**
   ```
   From Patterns to Themes:
   Pattern 1: Communication overwhelm
   Pattern 2: Information filtering strategies
   Pattern 3: Productivity impacts
   ↓
   Theme: "Digital Overwhelm and Coping Mechanisms"
   ```

2. **Theme Characteristics Definition**
   For each potential theme, define:
   - **Essence:** Core meaning in one sentence
   - **Boundaries:** What's included/excluded
   - **Dimensions:** Range or variations within theme
   - **Relationships:** How it connects to other themes

3. **Theme Hierarchy Development**
   ```
   Overarching Theme: Digital Work Transformation
   ├── Major Theme 1: Technology Adoption Patterns
   │   ├── Sub-theme: Learning curves
   │   └── Sub-theme: Resistance factors
   ├── Major Theme 2: Collaboration Evolution
   │   ├── Sub-theme: Virtual team dynamics
   │   └── Sub-theme: Communication preferences
   └── Major Theme 3: Work-Life Integration
       ├── Sub-theme: Boundary management
       └── Sub-theme: Flexibility benefits
   ```

**Theme Quality Criteria:**
- [ ] Internally coherent (codes fit together meaningfully)
- [ ] Externally distinct (clear boundaries with other themes)
- [ ] Substantial (enough data to support)
- [ ] Relevant (addresses research questions)
- [ ] Meaningful (provides insights)

**Elicitation Point 3:** [elicit: true]
Present initial theme construction. Offer options:

8. Validate with data
9. Test alternative structures

### Phase 4: Reviewing and Refining Themes

**Objective:** Ensure themes accurately represent the data

**Two-Level Review Process:**

1. **Level 1: Coded Extract Review**
   - Read all coded extracts for each theme
   - Check if they form coherent pattern
   - Identify extracts that don't fit
   - Consider theme modifications needed

   ```
   Theme Coherence Check:
   Theme: [Theme Name]
   Total Extracts: [Number]
   Coherent: [Number fitting well]
   Questionable: [Number maybe fitting]
   Misfit: [Number not fitting]
   Action: [Refine/Split/Merge/Maintain]
   ```

2. **Level 2: Full Dataset Review**
   - Check themes against entire dataset
   - Ensure nothing important missed
   - Validate theme boundaries
   - Confirm theme relationships

**Refinement Actions:**
- **Split:** Theme too broad, needs division
- **Merge:** Themes too similar, combine them
- **Discard:** Insufficient evidence, remove theme
- **Promote:** Sub-theme becomes major theme
- **Demote:** Major theme becomes sub-theme

**Elicitation Point 4:** [elicit: true]
Present refined themes after review. Offer options:
1. Proceed to Phase 5 (Theme Definition)
2. Further refine specific themes

   Sequential: Themes in temporal order
   Causal: One theme influences another
   Associative: Themes often co-occur
   Oppositional: Contrasting themes
   ```

2. **Visual Theme Map Structure**
   ```
   [Core Phenomenon]
         ↓
   [Antecedent Theme] → [Process Theme] → [Outcome Theme]
         ↑                    ↓                ↓
   [Contextual Theme]  [Moderating Theme]  [Impact Theme]
   ```
