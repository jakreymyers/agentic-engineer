# Research Quality Master Validation Checklist

This checklist serves as a comprehensive framework for validating user research projects throughout their lifecycle. It adapts intelligently based on research methodology (qualitative vs quantitative, interviews vs ethnography) and ensures rigorous research standards are maintained.

```
LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - RESEARCH QUALITY MASTER CHECKLIST

RESEARCH TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the research type by checking:

1. Is this QUALITATIVE research?
   - Look for: Interviews, focus groups, ethnography, observation
   - Check for: Discussion guides, thematic analysis, personas

2. Is this QUANTITATIVE research?
   - Look for: Surveys, conjoint analysis, experiments, A/B tests
   - Check for: Statistical analysis, sample size calculations, hypotheses

3. Is this MIXED METHODS research?
   - Look for: Combination of qual and quant approaches
   - Check for: Integration points, convergence analysis

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on research type, ensure you have access to:

For QUALITATIVE research:
- research-brief.md - The research brief document
- discussion-guide.md - Interview/focus group guide
- participant-criteria.md - Selection criteria
- analysis-framework.md - Coding and analysis approach

For QUANTITATIVE research:
- study-design.md - Experimental or survey design
- sample-plan.md - Sampling and power calculations
- analysis-plan.md - Statistical analysis approach
- hypothesis-register.md - Hypotheses and predictions

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:
- Skip sections marked [[QUALITATIVE ONLY]] for quantitative studies
- Skip sections marked [[QUANTITATIVE ONLY]] for qualitative studies
- Skip sections marked [[ETHNOGRAPHY ONLY]] for non-ethnographic studies
- Skip sections marked [[CONJOINT ONLY]] for non-conjoint studies
- Note all skipped sections in final report

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. Evidence-Based - Require documentation for each item
2. Methodological Rigor - Apply established research standards
3. Ethical Compliance - Ensure participant protection
4. Quality Assurance - Verify at each phase
5. Stakeholder Alignment - Check business value

EXECUTION MODE:
Ask the user if they want to work through the checklist:
- Phase by phase (interactive mode) - Review each phase, get confirmation
- All at once (comprehensive mode) - Complete full analysis and present report
