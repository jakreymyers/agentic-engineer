# Interview Quality Validation Checklist

This checklist ensures comprehensive quality validation for user research interviews, from preparation through analysis. It adapts based on interview type (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) and modality (in-person, remote, asynchronous).

```
LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - INTERVIEW QUALITY CHECKLIST

INTERVIEW TYPE DETECTION:
First, determine the interview characteristics:

1. STRUCTURE LEVEL:
   - Structured: Fixed questions, standardized order
   - Semi-structured: Core questions with flexibility
   - Unstructured: Open conversation, emergent topics

2. MODALITY:
   - In-person: Face-to-face interviews
   - Remote synchronous: Video/phone interviews
   - Asynchronous: Email, chat, or recorded responses

3. INTERVIEW CONTEXT:
   - Individual: One-on-one interviews
   - Dyad: Two participants together
   - Group: Focus groups or group interviews

DOCUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
Based on interview type, ensure access to:
- discussion-guide.md - Interview guide or protocol
- participant-profiles.md - Participant selection criteria
- consent-forms.md - Ethical approval documents
- technical-setup.md - Equipment and environment specs

SKIP INSTRUCTIONS:
- Skip [[IN-PERSON ONLY]] sections for remote interviews
- Skip [[REMOTE ONLY]] sections for in-person interviews
- Skip [[GROUP ONLY]] sections for individual interviews
- Note all skipped sections in validation summary

VALIDATION APPROACH:
1. Preparation thoroughness
2. Execution consistency
3. Participant experience
4. Data quality
5. Ethical compliance

QUALITY THRESHOLDS:
- Minimum 80% checklist completion for approval
- Any critical item failure requires immediate remediation
- Document all deviations with justification
