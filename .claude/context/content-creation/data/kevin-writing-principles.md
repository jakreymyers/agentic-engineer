# Kevin's Writing Principles

## The Core Philosophy

"Trust Through Expertise. Growth Through Sharing. Impact Through Clarity."

## The Non-Negotiables

### 1. Never Use AI for First Drafts

- AI assists research and editing only
- Authentic voice comes from human experience
- Personal stories can't be generated
- Your unique perspective is the value

### 2. Active Voice Always

- Subject performs the action
- Ban "enable" and "empower" - they create passive constructions
- "We analyzed the data" NOT "The data was analyzed"
- Clear accountability and agency in every sentence

### 3. Quote Sparingly

- Remove 9 quotes for every 10 in first drafts
- Paraphrase for clarity and flow
- Reserve quotes for pithy, memorable phrases
- Quotes make facts look like opinions

### 4. Show, Don't Tell

- Concrete examples over abstract praise
- Let readers draw their own conclusions
- "Our pipeline processed 10TB daily" NOT "Our pipeline was groundbreaking"
- Tangible descriptions win every time

### 5. Simplicity is King

- If you don't use it in conversation, don't write it
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Short sentences with punch
- No jargon unless absolutely necessary
- Acronyms only after first explanation

### 6. Dense Information is Boring

- Break complex info into digestible parts
- Use headers, bullets, and white space
- Always include YOUR perspective
- End with synthesis, not just summary

- Sets up a relatable problem other practitioners face

**Development Pattern:**

- References thought leaders and frameworks naturally
- Admits uncertainties and oversimplifications
- Uses parenthetical clarifications
- Varies list lengths (sometimes 2 points, sometimes 8)
- Self-corrects thinking mid-piece

**Closing Pattern:**

- Synthesizes learnings into broader principles
- Connects back to reader's similar challenges
- Often ends with gentle challenge or invitation to reflect

### LinkedIn Posts

1. Story-driven hook with specific context
2. Brief explanation of the challenge/lesson
3. Variable number of insights (2-7 points)
4. Connection to broader principle
5. Question that invites thoughtful engagement

### Blog Articles

1. Personal story that illustrates a common problem
2. Context and why traditional approaches fall short
3. Kevin's experience-based approach or framework

## Common Phrases to Avoid

### Corporate Speak

### AI Detection Red Flags

#### Overused Symbolism

- ❌ "Industry reports suggest..."
- ❌ "Observers have noted..."
- ❌ "Some critics argue..."
- ❌ "Studies show..." (without citing)
- ❌ "Experts believe..."
- ❌ "It's widely known that..."

#### Superficial Analysis

- ❌ "...ensuring [outcome]"
- ❌ "...highlighting [importance]"
- ❌ "...emphasizing [value]"
- ❌ "...reflecting [trend]"
- ❌ "...demonstrating [quality]"
- ❌ "...showcasing [feature]"

- ❌ "Groundbreaking"
- ❌ "Paradigm shift"

## Human Authenticity Markers

### Natural Variation

- **Vary sentence length wildly**: Some one word. Others ramble for 3-4 lines with multiple tangents
- **Break patterns aggressively**: 2 points. Then 11. Then back to 3. Never consistent.
- **Include fragments everywhere**: "The result? Chaos." "Brutal." "Actually, wait—"
- **Use contractions always**: "We'll" not "We will", "can't" not "cannot", "wouldn't've" sometimes
- **Deliberate typos**: One typo per post/article. Leave it. Fix in comments like "lol meant deployment not deplyoment"

### Personal Quirks

- Start sentences with "And", "But", "So", "Like"
- Use parenthetical asides (sometimes nested (like this))
- Include hyper-specific details: "Tuesday at 3:47pm" not "recently", "$2,847.32" not "around $3K"
- Reference actual tools with versions: "Excel 2019 row 1047" not "the spreadsheet"
- Name real people and companies: "When Patrick Collison tweeted..." not "industry leaders say"
- Self-correct mid-sentence: "We had 50—actually 47 users"

### Conversational Elements

- Direct questions without question marks: "You know what's wild"
- Self-interruption constantly: "Actually, scratch that. No wait, I was right the first time"
- Admissions of ignorance: "I still don't understand why AWS bills work like that"
- Hyper-specific numbers: "73.4%" not "majority", "$47,892" not "significant", "14 minutes" not "quickly"
- Exact time markers: "Last Tuesday at 3pm during the standup" not "recently"
- Mild profanity when frustrated: "This shit took forever" not "This was time-consuming"

### Natural Human Patterns (Kevin's Style)

- **Story-driven openings**: Real scenarios, names, and dialogue
- **Natural admissions**: "This is a dramatic simplification" or "I'll be honest, I don't fully understand why..."
- **Thought leader integration**: Naturally references Morgan Housel, Teresa Torres, etc.
- **Professional warmth**: Uses "folks", shows empathy for team challenges
- **Authentic corrections**: "Actually, let me be more specific about that"
- **Variable structures**: Sometimes 2 main points, sometimes 8 detailed sections
- **Parenthetical clarifications**: (like this one that adds helpful context)
- **Real tool/company names**: Epic, Tableau, FHIR, specific healthcare systems
- **Conversational connectors**: Natural "And" or "But" sentence starters
- **Honest uncertainty**: Admits when approaches might not work for everyone

### Story Elements That Feel Real

- Specific sensory details: "The coffee was cold and tasted like pennies"
- Actual dialogue: "My CEO literally yelled 'Just ship the damn thing'"
- Raw emotions: "I was fucking livid" not "I was frustrated"
- Physical descriptions: "Whiteboard covered in post-its, half falling off"
- Exact time pressure: "Had 11 minutes before the investor call"
- Embarrassing details: "I forgot to unmute for the first 2 minutes"
- Technical failures: "Git refused to merge because I'd been working in the wrong branch for 3 days"

### The Wikipedia AI Detection Killers

- **NEVER use "moreover", "furthermore", "in addition", "on the other hand"**
- **NEVER write "plays a vital/significant role"**
- **NEVER say "stands as a testament" or "serves as a symbol"**
- **NEVER use "underscores its importance" or "highlights the significance"**
- **NEVER write "it's important to note" or "it's worth mentioning"**
- **NEVER use vague attribution like "studies show" without citing**
- **NEVER write perfect parallel structures**
- **NEVER use consistent formatting throughout**
- **NEVER maintain the same tone for an entire piece**
- **NEVER use exactly 3-5 points in every list**

## Kevin's Go-To Structures

## Remember

> "The goal isn't to impress with vocabulary. It's to connect through clarity."

Every piece of content should:

- Challenge conventional thinking
- Provide practical value
- Sound like Kevin talking to a colleague

## The Ultimate Test

Read it aloud. If it doesn't sound like something Kevin would say over coffee, rewrite it.
