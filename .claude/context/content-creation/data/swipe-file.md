**Posted: December 15, 2024 | 64 reactions, 19 comments**

> We keep carving up Product Management into smaller buckets. It's tiring.
>
> Building data products does seem to require a slightly different approach to "building something people will pay for".
>
> After years building data products in healthcare, here's what I've learned:
>
> **General PMs ship outcomes  
> Data PMs ship trust**
>
> And in healthcare? That difference becomes critical.
>
> ## 4 Key Shifts Nobody Talks About
>
> ### 1. Risk Profile
>
> - General: Ship buggy code, push a fix
> - Data: Ship bad data, lose trust forever
>
> ### 2. Success Metrics
>
> - General: Usage, engagement, retention
> - Data: Data quality, decision velocity, trust signals
>
> ### 3. Customer Journey
>
> - General: "Wow, this is great!"
> - Data: "I don't trust this yet... but maybe..."
>
> ### 4. Team Structure
>
> - General: Product Trio (PM, Tech, Design)
> - Data: Product Quad (Trio + Data Lead)
>
> The most interesting part? Building data products in healthcare is like "playing on hard mode" - you're juggling quality risk with everything else.

**Why This Worked:**

- Contrarian hook that pissed people off (good!)
- Specific experience: "years in healthcare" not vague
- Actual comparisons people could relate to
- Healthcare angle = instant credibility
- Easy to scan (people are lazy)

### Vulnerability Share - Chasing Aptitude

**Posted: September 30, 2023 | 58 reactions, 2 comments**

> It might be time to stop chasing breadth, optionality, and prestige.
>
> It is for me.
>
> Time to switch to chasing aptitude and enjoyment.
>
> In design thinking, a common motion is moving between divergent and convergent thinking. You don't stay in divergent thinking forever. Being a generalist and doing "strategy" is not the end goal.
>
> Sometimes you have to put your head down and refine your craft.
>
> I'm doing that for data products in healthcare.
>
> Hold me accountable - join me - refine your own craft.

**Why This Worked:**

- Real vulnerability (not fake humble brag BS)
- Actually made a decision and stated it
- Everyone's been there with the career stuff
- Design thinking reference wasn't forced
- Asked for accountability = engagement

### Pattern Recognition - AI and Data Products

> Everyone's talking about how AI is "transforming data products."
>
> True. But here's what I've learned after years building data products in healthcare: the fundamentals haven't changed one bit.
>
> All the noise about LLMs and automated insights? That's just new supply trying to find the same old demand.
>
> ## 4 Things That Will Never Change
>
> ### 1. Trust Still Trumps Everything
>
> - Before AI: "I don't trust this data"
> - With AI: "I don't trust this AI-generated insight"
> - The technology changes, the trust problem doesn't
>
> ### 2. Context Is Still King
>
> - Raw data without business context = useless
> - AI insights without business context = still useless
> - No amount of automation fixes poor data modeling
>
> ### 3. Adoption Depends on Workflow Integration
>
> - Fancy dashboards that don't fit into daily routines fail
> - AI recommendations that require extra steps get ignored
> - If it doesn't make someone's job easier, it doesn't matter
>
> ### 4. Quality Problems Compound
>
> - Garbage in, garbage out (classic)
> - Garbage in, AI-amplified garbage out (modern)
> - Bad data quality kills AI products faster than traditional ones

**Why This Worked:**

- Challenged AI hype with practical reality
- Years of experience credibility marker
- Clear framework structure
- Concrete examples in each point
- Timely topic with evergreen insights

## Successful Hook Patterns from Jak

### The Contrarian Opening

- "We keep carving up Product Management into smaller buckets. It's tiring."
- "Everyone says measure what matters. But sometimes what matters can't be measured."
- "It might be time to stop chasing breadth, optionality, and prestige."

### The Experience Statement

- "After years building data products in healthcare, here's what I've learned:"
- "I spent three years building the wrong product. Here's what I learned."
- "After 10 years in healthcare tech, I've noticed the best products do one thing differently."

### The Industry Challenge

- "Everyone's talking about how AI is transforming data products. True. But..."
- "70% of data products fail. Not because of bad data, but because of trust."
- "The myth: More data equals better decisions. The reality: Trust beats volume every time."

## High-Engagement Comment Strategies

### Address the Audience, Not Just the Commenter

Instead of: "Thanks for the comment, John!"
Use: "John raises a great point that many of you have probably experienced..."

### Add Value in Every Response

Instead of: "Exactly!"
Use: "Exactly - and what I've found is that this pattern shows up most in companies where..."

### Ask Follow-up Questions

Instead of: "Good point."
Use: "Good point. Have you seen this work differently in [specific context]? I'm curious about your experience with..."
