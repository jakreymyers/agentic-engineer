- Reserve quotes for pithy phrases
- 1 quote per 10 in first draft

- Let readers draw conclusions
- Tangible descriptions win

### 5. Simplicity is King

- Short paragraphs and sentences
- No jargon or acronyms
- Conversational language only

### 6. Avoid AI Detection Patterns

- No "moreover", "furthermore", "it's important to note"
- Vary structure (not always 3-5 points)
- Include specific details (dates, numbers, names)
- Use contractions and colloquialisms
- Add human imperfections and personality

## Content Types & Strategies
