## Key Writing Principles

### 1. Never Use AI for First Drafts

- AI assists research and editing only
- Authentic voice comes from human experience
- Personal stories can't be generated

### 2. Active Voice Always

- Ban "enable" and "empower"
- Subject performs the action
- Clear accountability and agency

### 3. Quote Sparingly

- Paraphrase for clarity
- Reserve quotes for pithy phrases
- 1 quote per 10 in first draft

### 4. Show, Don't Tell

- Concrete examples over abstract praise
- Let readers draw conclusions
- Tangible descriptions win

### 5. Simplicity is King

- Short paragraphs and sentences
- No jargon or acronyms
- Conversational language only

### 6. Avoid AI Detection Patterns

- No "moreover", "furthermore", "it's important to note"
- Vary structure (not always 3-5 points)
- Include specific details (dates, numbers, names)
- Use contractions and colloquialisms
- Add human imperfections and personality

## Content Types & Strategies

### LinkedIn Posts

- **Hook**: One-line value proposition
- **Re-hook**: Address objection or add perspective
- **Structure**: Short paragraphs, easy scanning
- **Images**: Always 4:5 aspect ratio
- **Engagement**: Reply to audience, not just commenters

### Blog Articles

- **Opening**: Personal story or surprising fact
- **Structure**: Clear sections with headers

- Waiting for perfect timing
- Analysis without action
