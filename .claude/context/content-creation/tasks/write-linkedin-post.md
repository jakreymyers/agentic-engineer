# Write LinkedIn Post

## Task Overview

Transform an idea into a high-engagement LinkedIn post following Kevin's proven format and voice.

## Prerequisites

- Clear topic or insight to share
- Understanding of target audience (data PMs, healthcare tech, B2B SaaS)
- Access to Kevin's writing principles

## Steps

### 1. Idea Validation

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: structured**

I need to understand your post idea. Please provide:

1. **Core Topic**: What's the main idea? (e.g., "Why data PMs fail at stakeholder management")
2. **Key Insight**: What's the surprising or valuable takeaway?
3. **Target Audience**: Who specifically needs to hear this?
4. **Personal Angle**: What's Kevin's unique experience with this?

### 2. Hook Development

Based on your input, I'll create hook variations (might be 2, might be 6 - not always 3-5):

- Contrarian take ("Everyone's wrong about X")
- Surprising statistic ("73% of data products fail")
- Personal vulnerability ("I screwed this up for 3 years")
- Pattern recognition ("After seeing this 10 times...")
- Direct challenge ("You're probably doing X wrong")
- Specific moment ("Last Tuesday at 3pm I realized...")
- Dialogue opener ("My CEO said 'Just ship it'")

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: choice**

Here are your hook options:

### 3. Structure Creation

I'll build the post structure (but mix it up):

**Option A - Classic**
- Hook + Re-hook
- 2-7 insights (vary it!)
- Personal story
- CTA

**Option B - Story-First**
- Personal anecdote
- What I learned
- Here's the framework
- Try it yourself

**Option C - Data-Driven**
- Shocking stat
- Why it matters
- What I did about it
- Your move

**Option D - Contrarian**
- Challenge belief
- Evidence against it
- My experience
- What do you think?

### 4. Content Development

I'll write the full post following:

- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Active voice only
- Concrete examples
- Kevin's conversational tone
- Platform optimization

### 5. Format Optimization

I'll ensure:

- Proper line breaks for scanning
- Bold key concepts (sparingly)
- Total length 150-300 words
- No corporate jargon
- Natural flow

### 6. Final Review

**ELICIT: true**
**Format: confirm**

Here's your LinkedIn post:
