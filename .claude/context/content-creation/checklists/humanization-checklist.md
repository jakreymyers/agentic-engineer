# Humanization Checklist

## Pre-Writing Setup

- [ ] **Choose irregular structure** - Not 3-5 points. Maybe 2. Maybe 7.
- [ ] **Pick specific context** - Tuesday at 3pm, not "recently"
- [ ] **Name real things** - Actual tools, people, places
- [ ] **Set emotional tone** - Frustrated? Excited? Confused?

## During Writing

### Language Choices

- [ ] **Use contractions** - At least 1 per paragraph
- [ ] **Start with And/But** - At least once
- [ ] **Include fragments** - "The result? Chaos."
- [ ] **Add colloquialisms** - "Kicked the can", "dropped the ball"
- [ ] **Specific numbers** - $47K not "significant", 73% not "majority"

### Structural Variety

- [ ] **Vary paragraph length** - Some 1 line. Some 4 lines.
- [ ] **Mix sentence types** - Short. Then a longer one with multiple clauses.
- [ ] **Break patterns** - If you did 3 numbered points last time, do 2 or 6
- [ ] **Skip transitions** - Sometimes just jump to the next point
- [ ] **Incomplete lists** - "Things like X, Y, and whatever"

### Personal Elements

- [ ] **Parenthetical aside** - (you know what I mean?)
- [ ] **Self-interruption** - "Actually, wait..."
- [ ] **Admission of uncertainty** - "I'm not 100% sure but..."
- [ ] **Specific story detail** - "The coffee was cold"
- [ ] **Dialogue quote** - "My CEO literally said..."
- [ ] **Physical description** - "Whiteboard covered in post-its"
- [ ] **Time pressure** - "With 10 minutes before the demo"
- [ ] **Emotional reaction** - "I was pissed" not "frustrated"

## Post-Writing Review

### AI Pattern Removal

- [ ] **Search for "moreover"** - Replace with "And" or delete
- [ ] **Search for "furthermore"** - Replace with "Plus" or delete
- [ ] **Search for "plays a vital"** - Replace with "matters"
- [ ] **Search for "ensures"** - Replace with specific outcome
- [ ] **Search for "it's important to note"** - Delete
- [ ] **Search for "stands as"** - Replace with "is"
- [ ] **Check for perfect symmetry** - Break it
- [ ] **Check for vague attribution** - Make specific or delete

### Human Touch Additions

- [ ] **Add one typo** - Fix in comments later (builds authenticity)
- [ ] **Include tool name** - "Slack channel #data-team" not "communication platform"
- [ ] **Reference specific time** - "Last Tuesday's standup" not "recent meeting"
- [ ] **Name a person** - "Sarah from engineering" not "a colleague"
- [ ] **Add unexpected detail** - Something slightly off-topic but interesting

### Final Tests

- [ ] **Read aloud** - Does it sound like Jak at a bar?
- [ ] **Variety check** - Not everything the same length/structure
- [ ] **Personality check** - Can you hear Jak's voice?
- [ ] **AI detector scan** - Run through ai-pattern-detector.md
- [ ] **Authenticity gut check** - Too polished? Add roughness

## Emergency Humanization Tactics

If something still feels too AI:

1. **Add a mistake** - Then correct yourself
2. **Include profanity** - If appropriate (damn, hell, pissed)
3. **Reference pop culture** - Movie quote, meme, current event
4. **Make it messier** - Delete a transition, leave something implied
5. **Add specificity** - Excel row 1047, Jira ticket PROD-4521
6. **Include frustration** - "This took me 3 hours to figure out"
7. **Mention physical space** - "Standing desk", "conference room B"
8. **Add time context** - "Right before lunch", "During the AWS outage"

## Red Flags That Scream AI

NEVER use these:
- "In today's [industry]..."
- "As we navigate..."
- "In the ever-evolving..."
- "It's crucial to understand..."
- "Let's dive into..."
- "In conclusion..."
- "The journey of..."
- "Embracing the power of..."
- "Unlocking the potential..."
- "In this digital age..."

## Quick Humanization Formula

1. **Specific detail** + **emotional reaction** + **unexpected aside**
2. **Tool name** + **time marker** + **person reference**
3. **Mistake** + **correction** + **laugh about it**

Example:
"Last Tuesday (time marker) I was debugging in VS Code (tool name) when Sarah (person) walked by. I'd been staring at this bug for 3 hours (frustration). Turns out I forgot a semicolon. THREE HOURS. For a semicolon. (emotional reaction + CAPS for emphasis)"

## Remember

Perfect content looks AI-generated. Human content has:
- Rough edges
- Personality quirks
- Specific details
- Emotional moments
- Natural variation
- Occasional messiness

The goal: Sound like Jak talking, not ChatGPT writing.
