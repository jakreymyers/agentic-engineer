# Content Quality Checklist

## Kevin's Non-Negotiable Standards

### ✅ Writing Principles (MUST PASS ALL)

- [ ] **NO AI-generated first draft** - Human experience and voice only
- [ ] **Active voice throughout** - Subject performs action
- [ ] **No "enable" or "empower"** - These create passive constructions
- [ ] **Minimal quotes** - Max 1 per 10 quotes from draft
- [ ] **Concrete examples** - Show, don't tell with real scenarios
- [ ] **Simple language** - Would Kevin say this in conversation?
- [ ] **No unnecessary jargon** - Technical terms only when essential
- [ ] **Short paragraphs** - 2-3 lines maximum
- [ ] **Personal perspective** - Kevin's view, not generic wisdom

### ✅ Content Structure

- [ ] **Strong hook** - Stops the scroll in first line

### ✅ Technical Accuracy
