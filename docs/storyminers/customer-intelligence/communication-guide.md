## Communicating with Visionary CEOs

### Initial Outreach

#### Tone & Voice
- **Bold and visionary** while remaining grounded
- **Direct and concise**—respect their time
- **Peer-to-peer** language, not vendor-to-prospect

#### Message Structure
1. **Hook:** Reference a shared connection or recent achievement
2. **Challenge:** Acknowledge the strategic challenge they face
3. **Possibility:** Hint at a different approach
4. **Ask:** Simple, low-commitment next step

#### Example Message
> "Hi [Name], [Referrer] mentioned you're navigating a significant strategic shift at [Company]. I've helped leaders at McDonald's and Transitions Optical prototype their boldest ideas through story before making big bets. Would you be open to a brief conversation about reducing strategic risk while accelerating buy-in?"

### First Conversation

#### Approach
- Start with their vision, not your solution
- Ask about the gap between vision and current reality
- Share a brief, relevant client story
- Focus on outcomes, not process

#### Key Questions
- "What's the boldest move you'd make if you knew it would work?"
- "Where do you see the biggest disconnect between your vision and your team's understanding?"
- "What would change if everyone could see what you see?"

### Follow-Up Framework
- **Immediate:** Send a one-page visual summary
- **Week 1:** Share a relevant case study
- **Week 2:** Offer a Chemistry Check conversation
- **Ongoing:** Provide valuable insights without pushing
