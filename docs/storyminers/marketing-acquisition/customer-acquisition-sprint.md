### **Executive Summary**

This project brief outlines a focused 12-hour client acquisition sprint designed to secure the next high-value client for Storyminers. The primary problem is the immediate need for new client revenue to enable further business activities. The sprint will target 'Visionary CEOs' of mid-market companies ($50M–$5B+) who are struggling with strategic alignment and articulating their vision. The proposed solution is to leverage a hyper-targeted, signal-based research process, executed by a Chief of Staff, to identify and secure a 30-minute 'Chemistry Check,' with the ultimate goal of placing a proposal for a low-risk 'Future Story' engagement in front of a qualified prospect.

### Problem Statement

The primary business challenge is the immediate need to secure a new, high-value client to ensure positive cash flow, which is a prerequisite for all other strategic business activities. While numerous potential client acquisition strategies exist, there is a lack of clarity on which methods are most effective and efficient for Storyminers' trust-based, high-value services. Traditional, untargeted outreach methods are considered high-risk for being ineffective and potentially brand-damaging. The current state is a bottleneck where the absence of a systematic, modern client acquisition process is stalling overall business momentum and growth.

### Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a highly structured, 12-hour client acquisition sprint, executed by a Chief of Staff, designed to place a personalized proposal in front of a qualified 'Visionary CEO' prospect—whether a first-level contact, or a contact that can be introduced by someone you know. The core approach is to prioritize data-driven targeting over high-volume outreach.

This solution is differentiated from traditional methods by focusing on **'buying signals'** and leveraging the existing network to find warm introduction paths. This **highly relational approach** avoids low-trust, untargeted 'failure modes' and instead focuses on securing a low-friction **'Chemistry Check'** conversation as the entry point.

The high-level vision is to validate this 12-hour sprint as a repeatable, efficient playbook for future client acquisition efforts.

### Target Users

**Primary User Segment: The Visionary CEO (Primary Buyer)**

* **Profile**: A C-suite leader (CEO, President, CRO, etc.) aged 45-65 at a mid-market company ($50M–$5B+) in industries like specialty retail, healthcare, or manufacturing. They are a purpose-driven, collaborative visionary.  
* **Behaviors & Pains**: They often feel isolated and that their "people don't get them". They are trapped in day-to-day demands and struggle to articulate a compelling future, leading to stalled progress and internal resistance.  
* **Needs & Goals**: Their primary goal is to achieve bold revenue growth (25%-100%) and align their leadership team around a clear strategic vision, avoiding costly execution missteps. They need a structured, low-risk way to prototype their ideas before major investment.

**Secondary User Segment: The Trusted Advisor (Influencer)**

* **Profile**: A board member, attorney, banker, consultant, or executive coach aged 40-65 who is a rational, pragmatic, and risk-conscious confidant to the CEO.  
* **Behaviors & Pains**: They navigate sensitive internal politics and worry about leadership alignment and the CEO making costly strategic missteps that could damage their own credibility.  
* **Needs & Goals**: Their goal is to help the CEO confidently navigate high-stakes decisions while mitigating legal, financial, and operational risks. They value clear, structured strategies tied to measurable outcomes.

### Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives**

* To secure one new high-value client ($750/hr+) to generate immediate cash flow for the business.  
* To validate a scalable, 12-hour sprint as a repeatable playbook for future client acquisition.

**User Success Metrics**

* The project "user" (the Chief of Staff) can successfully execute the 12-hour sprint within the defined time and budget constraints.  
* Achieve a high conversion rate from initial personalized outreach to a scheduled "Chemistry Check".

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* **Success KPI**: At least 1 personalized proposal, **preferably for ongoing monthly advisory services**, is placed in front of a qualified prospect.  
* **Leading KPI**: At least 1 "Chemistry Check" meeting is scheduled.  
* **Activity KPI**: Personalized outreach is successfully sent to the top 3 prospects identPified during the research phase.  
* **Constraint KPI**: The entire process is completed within the 12-hour time and $1,000 budget limits.

### MVP Scope

For this project, the "Minimum Viable Product" is the successful execution of the 12-hour client acquisition sprint.

**Core Features (Must Have)**

* **Research**: Execution of both Blind Spot/Relationship Mapping and Buying Signal Intelligence to generate a targeted list of prospects.  
* **Synthesis**: A dedicated session to analyze research and select the top 1-3 prospects for outreach.  
* **Outreach**: Crafting and sending personalized messages with the goal of securing a "Chemistry Check".  
* **Proposal**: Preparing and placing a personalized proposal in front of at least one prospect who has agreed to receive it.

**Out of Scope for MVP**

* Building a long-term, automated lead-tracking system.  
* Creating a generic, reusable marketing campaign.  
* Contacting more than a small, hyper-targeted list of prospects (e.g., 3-5).  
* Securing a signed contract *within* the 12-hour sprint.  
* General marketing material updates (e.g., website changes, brochures).

**MVP Success Criteria**

* The MVP is considered successful when at least one personalized proposal, preferably for ongoing monthly advisory services, has been placed in front of a qualified prospect.

### Post-MVP Vision

**Phase 2 Features**

* **Repeat & Refine**: Conduct a second 12-hour sprint to confirm the process is repeatable and refine the tactics based on learnings from the first.  
* **Codify Learnings**: Formally update the "Ideal Client Profile" and "Buying Signals" checklist with data from the successful sprint.  
* **Develop Outreach Playbooks**: Create a set of high-quality, semi-standardized outreach templates for the most common buying signal cohorts.

**Long-term Vision**

* To develop this manual sprint into a consistent, semi-automated client acquisition engine. This system would proactively monitor for buying signals and surface a steady stream of highly qualified leads to the Chief of Staff, making client acquisition a predictable and scalable business process.

**Expansion Opportunities**

* Apply this signal-based acquisition model to other Storyminers service offerings.  
* Build a small, custom internal tool to further automate parts of the enrichment and signal-tracking process.  
* Expand the target ICP to adjacent markets or different leadership roles once this initial model is perfected.

### Technical Considerations

**Platform Requirements**

* The primary platform for research and networking is **LinkedIn**, preferably with a Sales Navigator subscription to enable advanced filtering.  
* Standard office suite tools (e.g., Google Workspace) and a project management space in **Notion** will be required for document creation, tracking, and setting up news alerts.

**Technology Preferences**

* There is a strong preference for using **AI-assisted tools** to execute the "Enrichment & Signal Detection" phase of the sprint, in order to efficiently process the long list of prospects.  
* Project tracking and documentation will be managed in **Notion**, though spreadsheets may be used for initial list manipulation.

**Architecture Considerations**

* The information architecture for this sprint will follow a linear data flow: Raw prospect list from LinkedIn \-\> Filtered "Long List" \-\> AI-enriched list with "Signal Scores" \-\> Targeted "Short List" for outreach \-\> Final brief on qualified leads.

### onstraints & Assumptions

**Constraints**

* **Budget**: The sprint is limited to a **$1,000** budget for any tools or services.  
* **Timeline**: The sprint must be completed within a **12-hour** time box.  
* **Resources**: The work will be executed by a fractional Chief of Staff with defined availability, supported by Mike for key decision-making and outreach phases.

**Key Assumptions**

* It is assumed the Chief of Staff has the requisite skills in research, marketing, and the specified tools (LinkedIn, AI assistants, Notion) to execute the plan.  
* It is assumed that our defined "Ideal Client Profile" and "Buying Signals" are sufficiently accurate to identify qualified prospects.  
* It is assumed that high-level prospects are reachable and that a "Chemistry Check" can be scheduled within the sprint's short timeframe.  
* It is assumed you will be available for the critical 'Synthesis & Targeting' and 'Outreach' phases.

### Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks**

* **Hypothesis Risk**: The defined "Ideal Client Profile" and "Buying Signals" may not be accurate, leading to a list of prospects who are not actually ready to buy.  
* **Execution Risk**: The 12-hour timeframe is highly ambitious and may not be sufficient for the depth of research and personalized outreach required.  
* **Conversion Risk**: C-level executives are difficult to reach, and even a perfect, warm outreach may not result in a "Chemistry Check" within the sprint's duration.

**Open Questions**

* Which specific buying signal will prove to be the most effective predictor of interest?  
* What is the average time required to fully research and enrich one prospect?  
* What is the typical response latency for the target CEO profile?  
* What is the most effective use of the $1,000 budget (e.g., data tools, short-term subscriptions, etc.)?

**Areas Needing Further Research**

* A brief (30-min) time-boxed exploration of AI enrichment tools to find one that is effective and fits within the budget.  
* A quick review of your past 3-5 successful client acquisitions to identify any common trigger events.

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**

1. Conduct the pre-sprint research tasks identified in the 'Risks & Open Questions' section (tool scouting and review of past clients).  
2. Formally hand off this completed Project Brief to the Chief of Staff.  
3. Schedule the 12-hour sprint and the key stakeholder check-in points on the calendar.

**Handoff to Chief of Staff**
